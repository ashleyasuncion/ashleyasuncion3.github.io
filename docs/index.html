Meanwhile, his mother, a loving housewife, provided the emotional support and care that shaped Clent's character.

However, he grappled with Mathematics and Filipino History, viewing them as areas demanding further attention. Notably, Clent possessed a natural artistic inclination, showcasing talent in sketching and painting. Despite his active participation in physical activities, his potential to develop athletic skills remained untapped due to financial and social constraints.</p>
